			<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2> <br>
	     		<p class="food-text">
	     		Humans need vitamins and minerals in small quantities. These are called micronutrients.<br> Insufficient intake can lead to sickness, poor physical health, depression, and decreased life expectancy. <br> <br>	  
	     		</p>
			
	     		<p class="food-text">
	     		The FDA lists <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/99069/download">27 micronutrients </a> as essential for human health.
	     		It would be very difficult for an individual to keep track of their intake of each. <br> <br>	  
	     		Rules of thumb are crude: <br>
	     		Adding to the average British diet an apple, cherries, an onion, cranberry juice, and chestnuts would complete the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/5-a-day-what-counts/">five a day</a>, but fail to address any deficiencies. <br> <br>	  
	     		
	     		Aiming for a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eat-the-rainbow">colourful diet </a> could increase variety, but there are colourful fruit (such as grapes and plums) that add little. A greener diet may be a better goal.<br> <br>
	     		There is also a lot of misinformation. It may be surprising to read that:<br>
	     		Peppers contain more Vitamin C than oranges.<br>
	     		Bananas are a mediocre source of potassium.<br>
	     		Cheese and tahini contain equal amounts of calcium.<br><br>		
	     		
	     		The aim of this project is to allow individuals to address any deficiencies in their diet with the minimum of time, effort and cost.
